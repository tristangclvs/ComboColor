ComboColor is a game of territorial conquest in 1 vs 1.
Each player controls two colors: 
- Player 1: Red and Blue
- Player 2 : Green and Yellow  
When clicking, the colors alternate according to this scheme: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Red ...
You will see on the game tables, that some zones give points (positive and negative) or multiply the scores already obtained.

Each color has its own score, calculated by multiplying the "addition/subtraction" part with the "multiplication" part.
The total score of a player will be determined by the MULTIPLICATION of the scores of his respective colors. 
So be careful not to neglect any color, 
it could turn against you if it goes negative!
